<p> College </p>

<p> I first started college in 2018, which is considerably late considering that I graduated high school in 2013.
    However,
    while in the military it can be challenging to convince yourself to attend college due to the unpredicted work
    schedule.
    Since being in the military this is the third college that I have attended. I think that I made the right choice
    with <span id="bellevueUniversity"> __________________
</span>, due to the curriculum taught.
</p>

<p> There are a lot of schools that have a <span id="bachelorsOfScience">
____________________ </span> in computer science, and although most jobs in that industry ask for a degree in
    computer science or a related field I wanted to focus my studies on exactly that. </p>

<p> I researched tons of schools curriculum and a lot of schools have bachelors degrees in <span
        id="softwareDevelopment"> ____________________ </span>, but they are always Bachelor of Arts. Although it may
    not matter I really wanted a Bachelor of Science. My unprofessional opinion is that it would carry more weight. It
    was
    a plus that all the major requirements are a cohort and help keep you accountable by your peers to stay persistent
    while
    pursuing your <span
            id="degree"> ______ </span>. </p>
